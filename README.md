## Task Descriptions

### **Level 1**
1. **Task 1: Top Cuisines**
   - **Objective**: Determine the top three most common cuisines in the dataset and calculate the percentage of restaurants serving each cuisine.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Identified the top cuisines and their frequencies.
     - Visualized results using bar charts for better understanding.

2. **Task 2: City Analysis**
   - **Objective**:
     - Identify the city with the highest number of restaurants.
     - Calculate the average restaurant rating in each city.
     - Determine the city with the highest average rating.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Aggregated restaurant data by city to analyze trends.

3. **Task 3: Price Range Distribution**
   - **Objective**: 
     - Visualize the distribution of price ranges among restaurants using histograms or bar charts.
     - Calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Explored price ranges and their distributions.

4. **Task 4: Online Delivery**
   - **Objective**:
     - Determine the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
     - Compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Highlighted differences in ratings based on delivery options.

### **Level 2**
1. **Task 1: Restaurant Ratings**
   - **Objective**:
     - Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings and identify the most common rating range.
     - Calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Visualized the rating distribution and explored voting trends.

2. **Task 2: Cuisine Combination**
   - **Objective**:
     - Identify the most common cuisine combinations in the dataset.
     - Analyze if certain combinations have higher ratings.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Discovered trends in popular cuisine pairings and their ratings.

3. **Task 3: Geographic Analysis**
   - **Objective**:
     - Plot restaurant locations using longitude and latitude data.
     - Identify patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Generated maps to visualize geographic distribution.

4. **Task 4: Restaurant Chains**
   - **Objective**:
     - Identify restaurant chains in the dataset.
     - Analyze their ratings and popularity.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Examined performance trends of popular chains.

## Key Takeaways and Overall Analysis
Level 1 Insights:
Cities and cuisines showed significant diversity in restaurant data.
Online delivery services are linked to slightly better ratings on average.
Level 2 Insights:
Certain cuisine combinations and restaurant chains perform better in terms of ratings and popularity.
Geographic distribution showed clustering in urban hubs.
This analysis demonstrates how data can uncover patterns and insights to guide decision-making in the restaurant industry.
